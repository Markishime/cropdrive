# üìä Google Sheets Integration Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up automatic payment tracking in Google Sheets alongside your Firebase database.

---

## üéØ What You'll Get

Every time a user purchases a plan through Stripe, the webhook will automatically record:
- ‚úÖ **Timestamp** - When the payment was made
- ‚úÖ **Email & Name** - Customer details
- ‚úÖ **Plan Information** - Which plan they purchased
- ‚úÖ **Payment Amount** - How much they paid
- ‚úÖ **Billing Cycle** - Monthly or Yearly
- ‚úÖ **Status** - Active, Canceled, Past Due, etc.
- ‚úÖ **Stripe IDs** - Customer & Subscription IDs
- ‚úÖ **Dates** - Start and end dates

All data is also saved to Firebase, so Google Sheets is a **supplementary tracking system** for easy viewing and reporting.

---

### **Step 2: Enable Google Sheets API**

1. In your Google Cloud Console, make sure your project is selected
2. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library
3. Search for **"Google Sheets API"**
4. Click on **"Google Sheets API"**
5. Click **"Enable"**
6. Wait for activation (~10 seconds)

---

### **Step 3: Create Service Account**

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts
2. Click **"Create Service Account"**
3. Fill in details:
   - **Service account name**: `cropdrive-sheets`
   - **Service account ID**: `cropdrive-sheets` (auto-filled)
   - **Description**: `Service account for writing payment records to Google Sheets`
4. Click **"Create and Continue"**
5. For **"Grant this service account access to project"**:
   - Skip this step (not required)
   - Click **"Continue"**
6. For **"Grant users access to this service account"**:
   - Skip this step
   - Click **"Done"**

---

### **Step 4: Create Service Account Key**

1. On the Service Accounts page, find your `cropdrive-sheets` account
2. Click on the **email** (e.g., `cropdrive-sheets@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com`)
3. Go to the **"Keys"** tab
4. Click **"Add Key"** ‚Üí **"Create new key"**
5. Select **"JSON"** format
6. Click **"Create"**
7. A JSON file will download - **KEEP THIS FILE SAFE!** ‚ö†Ô∏è

The JSON file looks like this:
```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "your-project-id",
  "private_key_id": "...",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "cropdrive-sheets@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "client_id": "...",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
  ...
}
```

---

### **Step 5: Create Google Sheet**

1. Go to: https://sheets.google.com/
2. Click **"Blank"** to create a new spreadsheet
3. Rename it to: **"CropDrive Payment Records"**
4. Rename the first sheet tab to: **"Payments"**
5. Copy the **Spreadsheet ID** from the URL:
   ```
   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/[SPREADSHEET_ID]/edit
   ```
   For example, if your URL is:
   ```
   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BxiMVs0XRA5nFMdKvBdBZjgmUUqptlbs74OgvE2upms/edit
   ```
   Your Spreadsheet ID is: `1BxiMVs0XRA5nFMdKvBdBZjgmUUqptlbs74OgvE2upms`

---

### **Step 6: Share Sheet with Service Account**

1. In your Google Sheet, click **"Share"** (top right)
2. In the **"Add people and groups"** field, paste the **client_email** from your JSON file
   - Example: `cropdrive-sheets@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
3. Change permission to **"Editor"**
4. **UNCHECK** "Notify people" (it's a service account, not a person)
5. Click **"Share"**

‚úÖ Your service account now has permission to write to this sheet!

---

### **Step 7: Add Credentials to .env.local**

1. Open your `.env.local` file in your project
2. Add these three new variables:

```env
# Google Sheets Integration
GOOGLE_SHEETS_CLIENT_EMAIL=cropdrive-sheets@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
GOOGLE_SHEETS_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYourPrivateKeyHere\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
GOOGLE_SHEETS_SPREADSHEET_ID=1BxiMVs0XRA5nFMdKvBdBZjgmUUqptlbs74OgvE2upms
```

**Important Notes:**
- Replace `GOOGLE_SHEETS_CLIENT_EMAIL` with the `client_email` from your JSON file
- Replace `GOOGLE_SHEETS_PRIVATE_KEY` with the `private_key` from your JSON file
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Keep the quotes around the private key!**
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Keep the `\n` characters in the key!**
- Replace `GOOGLE_SHEETS_SPREADSHEET_ID` with your spreadsheet ID (from Step 5)

---

### **Step 8: Initialize the Google Sheet**

Now we'll set up the headers in your Google Sheet automatically.

1. Open your terminal in the project directory
2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. In a new terminal, run this command to initialize the sheet:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/stripe/init-sheets
   ```

This will:
- ‚úÖ Add headers to your Google Sheet
- ‚úÖ Format the headers (green background, bold text)
- ‚úÖ Freeze the header row
- ‚úÖ Set up column widths

You should see:
```
‚úÖ Google Sheets initialized successfully!
```

**Your Google Sheet will now have these columns:**

| Timestamp | Email | Name | Plan ID | Plan Name | Amount | Currency | Billing Cycle | Status | Stripe Customer ID | Stripe Subscription ID | Start Date | End Date |
|-----------|-------|------|---------|-----------|--------|----------|---------------|--------|-------------------|----------------------|------------|----------|

4. Wait for webhook to process (~2-3 seconds)
5. **Check your Google Sheet** - a new row should appear! ‚ú®

2. Click "Share"
3. Make sure the service account email is listed with "Editor" permission
4. Try the test again

---

### **Issue: "Spreadsheet not found"**

---

### **Issue: "Failed to initialize Google Sheets"**
**Cause:** API not enabled or credentials invalid

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### **Before deploying to production:**

1. ‚úÖ Create a separate Google Sheet for production data
2. ‚úÖ Add production spreadsheet ID to production environment variables
3. ‚úÖ Keep the same service account (or create a new one for production)
4. ‚úÖ Share the production sheet with the service account
5. ‚úÖ Test with a real payment in Stripe test mode first

### **Environment Variables for Production:**

In your hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.), add:
```
GOOGLE_SHEETS_CLIENT_EMAIL=cropdrive-sheets@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
GOOGLE_SHEETS_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
GOOGLE_SHEETS_SPREADSHEET_ID=your-production-spreadsheet-id
