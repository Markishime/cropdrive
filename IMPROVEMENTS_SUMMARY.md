# CropDrive Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the improvements made to the CropDrive application based on user requirements.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. âœ… Pricing Page - Stripe Checkout in Same Window
**Status:** Completed  
**Location:** `src/app/pricing/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Modified the checkout flow to redirect to Stripe in the **same window** instead of opening a new tab
- Removed `window.open()` and replaced with `window.location.href = url`
- Added a loading toast notification with "Redirecting to Stripe..." message
- Added a 500ms delay before redirect for better UX

**Before:**
```typescript
const stripeWindow = window.open(url, '_blank', 'noopener,noreferrer');
```

**After:**
```typescript
toast.loading(
  language === 'ms'
    ? 'ðŸ”„ Mengalihkan ke Stripe...'
    : 'ðŸ”„ Redirecting to Stripe...',
  { duration: 2000 }
);
setTimeout(() => {
  window.location.href = url;
}, 500);
```

### 2. âœ… Dashboard Plan Display
**Status:** Completed  
**Location:** `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Current Implementation (Already Working):**
- Dashboard automatically polls for updates when `?refresh=true` query parameter is present
- Polling occurs 5 times over 10 seconds (2-second intervals) to ensure webhook has processed
- Displays a fixed "Updating your plan..." toast notification during refresh
- Shows detailed plan information including:
  - Plan name and badge
  - Plan features with checkmarks
  - Upload limit
  - Response time
  - Renewal discount
  - Subscription info (price, billing cycle)

**Features Displayed:**
- âœ… Current plan name and badge
- âœ… All plan features with visual indicators
- âœ… Upload usage and remaining uploads
- âœ… Days active
- âœ… Total reports
- âœ… Quick actions (Start AI Analysis, Upgrade Plan)

**Refresh Flow:**
1. User completes purchase on Stripe
2. Success page redirects to `/dashboard?refresh=true` after 5 seconds
3. Dashboard detects `refresh=true` parameter
4. Initiates polling mechanism (5 times over 10 seconds)
5. Calls `refreshUser()` from auth context to fetch latest data from Firestore
6. Updates UI with new plan information
7. Cleans URL by removing `?refresh=true`

---

### 3. âœ… "Choose Plan Above" Button
**Status:** Completed  
**Location:** `src/app/pricing/page.tsx` (line 804-808)

**Current Implementation (Already Working):**
- Button uses `window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' })` to smoothly scroll to the top
- Located in the CTA section for users who are logged in but don't have a plan
- Provides smooth scrolling behavior to return users to the pricing cards

**Button Code:**
```typescript
<button
  onClick={() => window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' })}
  className="px-10 py-5 bg-yellow-400 text-green-900 rounded-lg font-bold uppercase text-base tracking-wider hover:bg-yellow-300 transition-all duration-200 shadow-xl hover:shadow-2xl transform hover:scale-105"
>
  {language === 'ms' ? 'Pilih Pelan Di Atas' : 'Choose Plan Above'}
</button>
```

---

### 4. âœ… Contact Form ("Send a Message")
**Status:** Completed  
**Location:** `src/app/contact/page.tsx`

**Current Implementation (Already Working):**
- Form saves messages to Firebase Firestore
- Shows toast notifications for success/error
- Pre-fills user data if logged in (name, email)
- All fields are validated (name, email, subject, message required)
- Phone field is optional

**Enhanced:**
- Added loading spinner to submit button
- Improved visual feedback during submission
- Displays "Sending..." text with animated spinner
- Uses custom styled toast notifications matching the UI theme

**Firestore Structure:**
```typescript
{
  name: string,
  email: string,
  phone: string,
  subject: string,
  message: string,
  userId: string | null,
  status: 'pending',
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  language: 'en' | 'ms'
}
```

## Technical Details

### Authentication & User Refresh
**Location:** `src/lib/auth.tsx`

The `refreshUser` function properly fetches the latest user data from Firestore:

```typescript
const refreshUser = async (): Promise<void> => {
  try {
    const currentUser = auth.currentUser;
    if (currentUser) {
      console.log('Refreshing user data from Firestore...');
      const convertedUser = await convertFirebaseUser(currentUser);
      setUser(convertedUser);
      console.log('User data refreshed:', convertedUser?.plan);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error refreshing user:', error);
  }
};
```

### Plan Data Retrieval
**Location:** `src/lib/subscriptions.ts`

Plans are retrieved using `getPlanById()`:

```typescript
export const getPlanById = (id: string): SubscriptionPlan | undefined => {
  return SUBSCRIPTION_PLANS[id];
};
```

### Success Page Redirect
**Location:** `src/app/success/page.tsx`

Success page includes:
- 5-second auto-redirect countdown
- Manual "Go to Dashboard Now" button
- Both redirect to `/dashboard?refresh=true` to trigger user data refresh
