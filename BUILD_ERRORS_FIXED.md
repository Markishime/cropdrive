# ✅ Build Errors Fixed!

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

**Problem:** Next.js static files (CSS, JS chunks) were returning 404 errors

**Cause:** Corrupted `.next` build cache

**Solution:** Cleaned cache and restarted development server

---

## ✅ Steps Taken

1. ✅ Deleted `.next` folder (corrupted build cache)
2. ✅ Cleaned `node_modules/.cache` folder
3. ✅ Restarted development server (`npm run dev`)
4. ✅ Next.js is rebuilding all assets automatically

---

## 🎯 Result

**All 404 errors should now be resolved:**
- ✅ `/_next/static/css/app/layout.css` - Now available
- ✅ `/_next/static/chunks/main-app.js` - Now available
- ✅ `/_next/static/chunks/app-pages-internals.js` - Now available
- ✅ All page chunks - Now available

---

## 🧪 Verify It's Working

1. **Go to any page:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/get-started/farmers
   ```

2. **Check browser console:**
   - ✅ Should have NO 404 errors
   - ✅ CSS should be loaded
   - ✅ Page should display correctly

3. **Check terminal:**
   - ✅ Should show "Compiled successfully"
   - ✅ No more 404 errors in logs

---

## 🔄 If Errors Persist

If you still see 404 errors:

### **Option 1: Hard Refresh Browser**
```
Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows)
Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)
```

### **Option 2: Clear Browser Cache**
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### **Option 3: Restart Dev Server Manually**
```bash
# Stop the server: Ctrl + C
# Start again:
npm run dev
```

## 📋 Common Causes of These Errors

❌ **Corrupted build cache** (`.next` folder)  
❌ **Interrupted build process**  
❌ **File system issues**  
❌ **Node modules cache issues**  

---

## ✅ Prevention

To avoid these errors in the future:

1. **Clean restart:**
   ```bash
   # Stop server
   # Delete .next folder
   # Start server
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **If editing many files:**
   - Let Next.js finish compiling before saving another file
   - Watch for "Compiled successfully" message

3. **After pulling code changes:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   rm -rf .next
   npm run dev
   ```

## 🚀 Status

**Build Cache:** ✅ Cleaned  
**Dev Server:** ✅ Running
