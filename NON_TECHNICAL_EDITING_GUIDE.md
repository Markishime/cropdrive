## üñºÔ∏è How to Change Images

### Understanding the Image Folder Structure

All website images are stored in: **`public/images/`**

```
public/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ images/
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CropDrive.png (Your logo)
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ icon-192x192.png (App icon small)
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ icon-512x512.png (App icon large)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ videos/
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Farmer_s_Oil_Palm_Land_Drone_Shot.mp4
```

### Step 1: Adding New Images

1. Prepare your image:
   - **Logo**: PNG format, 500x500 pixels recommended
   - **Hero images**: JPG/PNG, 1920x1080 pixels recommended
   - **Icons**: PNG with transparent background

2. Copy your image file into `public/images/` folder

3. Give it a clear name (e.g., `new-logo.png`, `hero-farm.jpg`)

### Step 2: Using Copilot to Replace Images

**Copilot Prompt for Logo Change:**
```
I want to replace the CropDrive logo throughout the website.
I have a new logo file called "new-logo.png" in the public/images folder.
Show me all places where the logo is used and help me update them to use my new logo.
```

**Copilot Prompt for Homepage Background:**
```
I want to add a new hero background image on the homepage.
My image is called "farm-background.jpg" in public/images.
Help me replace the current hero section background with my new image.
```

### Manual Image Replacement (If Needed)

1. Press **Ctrl + Shift + F** to search all files
2. Search for the old image name (e.g., `CropDrive.png`)
3. Files will appear showing where the image is used
4. Change the image filename to your new image
5. Save the file (**Ctrl + S**)

### Common Image Locations

| Image Type | File Location | What It Controls |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| **Website Logo** | `src/components/Navbar.tsx`<br>`src/components/Sidebar.tsx`<br>`src/app/login/page.tsx`<br>`src/app/register/page.tsx` | Logo shown in navigation, sidebar, login/register pages |
| **Favicon (browser tab icon)** | `public/favicon.ico` | Small icon in browser tabs |
| **App Icons** | `public/images/icon-*.png` | Icons when website is added to phone home screen |
| **Hero/Background Images** | `src/app/page.tsx` | Main homepage images |

### Image Optimization Tips

‚úÖ **Do's:**
- Use JPG for photos (smaller file size)
- Use PNG for logos and graphics (transparency support)
- Keep logos under 200KB
- Keep hero images under 500KB

‚ùå **Don'ts:**
- Don't use huge uncompressed images (slows down website)
- Don't use spaces in filenames (use dashes: `my-logo.png`)
- Don't use special characters in filenames

### Quick Image Replacement Example

**To change the logo:**

1. Copy your new logo to `public/images/` and name it `CropDrive.png` (replace existing)
2. Refresh your browser
3. Done! The logo updates everywhere automatically

## üß™ Testing Your Changes

### Always Test Before Publishing!

**Testing Checklist:**

1. ‚úÖ **Check the local website** (http://localhost:3000)
   - Click through all pages
   - Verify text changes appear correctly

## üéØ Best Practices for Non-Technical Users

### ‚úÖ Do's:

1. **Always test locally before publishing**
   - Run `npm run dev` and check http://localhost:3000
   
2. **Make small changes at a time**
   - Change one thing, test, then move to the next
   
3. **Use meaningful commit messages**
   - Good: "Updated pricing page with new prices"
   - Bad: "changes"
   
4. **Keep a backup**
   - Before making big changes, take screenshots
   
5. **Use GitHub Copilot for guidance**
   - When in doubt, ask Copilot!

### ‚ùå Don'ts:

1. **Don't change files outside of these folders:**
   - ‚úÖ Safe: `src/app/`, `src/components/`, `public/images/`
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Risky: `src/lib/`, `node_modules/`, configuration files
   
2. **Don't delete files you don't recognize**
   - If unsure, ask Copilot first
   
3. **Don't commit to git without testing**
   - Always check the website works first
   
4. **Don't panic if something breaks**
   - You can always undo changes
   - Ask Copilot for help
