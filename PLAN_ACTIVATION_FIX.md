# Plan Activation Fix - Summary

## Problem
After purchasing a plan, the dashboard continued to show "No Active Plan" even after the "Updating your plan" notifications completed.

## Root Cause
The application was using **direct Stripe Payment Links** (URLs starting with `https://buy.stripe.com/`) instead of proper **Stripe Checkout Sessions**. 

Direct payment links have a critical limitation:
- They only pass `client_reference_id` to webhooks
- They don't include essential metadata (`planId`, `isYearly`)
- Without this metadata, the webhook couldn't update the user's plan in Firestore

## Solution Implemented

### 1. ✅ Extended Success Page Timer (15 seconds)
**File:** `src/app/success/page.tsx`

**Change:**
```typescript
// Before
const [countdown, setCountdown] = React.useState(5);

// After
const [countdown, setCountdown] = React.useState(15);
```

**Impact:** Gives webhooks more time to process before redirecting to dashboard.

---

### 2. ✅ Extended Dashboard Polling (30 seconds)
**File:** `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Increased from 5 polls (10 seconds) to **10 polls (30 seconds)**
- Changed interval from 2 seconds to **3 seconds**
- Added 2-second initial delay before first poll
- Improved error handling

**New Configuration:**
```typescript
const maxPolls = 10;           // 10 attempts (was 5)
const pollInterval = 3000;     // 3 seconds (was 2)
// Total polling time: 30 seconds (was 10)
```

**Impact:** More time for webhook processing and user data synchronization.

### 3. ✅ Fixed Stripe Checkout to Always Use Sessions
**File:** `src/app/api/stripe/create-checkout/route.ts`

**Critical Fix:**
Removed the direct payment link logic and forced all checkouts to use **Stripe Checkout Sessions**:

```typescript
// Now detects payment links and converts them
if (priceId && priceId.startsWith('https://buy.stripe.com')) {
  console.warn('⚠️ Direct Stripe payment link detected. Converting to checkout session...');
  priceId = null; // Force inline pricing for proper metadata
}

// Always creates a Stripe Checkout Session with full metadata:
const sessionConfig = {
  metadata: {
    userId: userId,
    planId: planId,
    isYearly: isYearly.toString(),
  },
  subscription_data: {
    metadata: {
      userId: userId,
      planId: planId,
      isYearly: isYearly.toString(),
    },
  },
  // ... other config
};
```

**Why This Matters:**
- ✅ Metadata is now **always** included in the checkout session
- ✅ Webhooks receive all necessary data to update the user's plan
- ✅ No more "missing planId" or "missing userId" errors

---

### 4. ✅ Enhanced Webhook Logging
**File:** `src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`

**Improvements:**
1. Added comprehensive logging at each step
2. Better error messages when metadata is missing
3. Detailed console output for debugging

**New Logging:**
```typescript
console.log('🔔 Webhook: checkout.session.completed received');
console.log('Session ID:', session.id);
console.log('Session metadata:', session.metadata);

// ... processing ...

console.log('✅✅✅ USER PLAN UPDATED SUCCESSFULLY ✅✅✅');
console.log('User:', userId);
console.log('New plan:', planId);
console.log('Upload limit:', limits.uploadsLimit);
```

**Impact:** Easy to diagnose any future webhook issues by checking server logs.

## How It Works Now

### Complete Purchase Flow:

```
1. User clicks "Buy Plan"
   ↓
2. API creates Stripe Checkout Session (with metadata)
   ✅ metadata.userId
   ✅ metadata.planId
   ✅ metadata.isYearly
   ↓
3. User completes payment on Stripe
   ↓
4. Stripe sends webhook: checkout.session.completed
   ↓
5. Webhook receives session with full metadata
   ↓
6. Webhook updates Firestore:
   - user.plan = planId (e.g., "smart")
   - user.uploadsLimit = limit (e.g., 50)
   - user.uploadsUsed = 0
   - user.stripeCustomerId = customerId
   - user.stripeSubscriptionId = subscriptionId
   ↓
7. Stripe redirects to /success page
   ↓
8. Success page waits 15 seconds (countdown)
   ↓
9. Redirects to /dashboard?refresh=true
   ↓
10. Dashboard starts polling (10 attempts × 3 seconds)
    ↓
11. Each poll calls refreshUser() to fetch latest Firestore data
    ↓
12. Dashboard detects plan and displays:
    - Plan name and badge
    - Plan features
    - Upload limits
    - Subscription details
```

## Configuration

### Stripe Environment Variables

If you're using Stripe Price IDs, make sure they are actual Price IDs (e.g., `price_xxxxx`), **NOT** payment link URLs:

```bash
# ✅ CORRECT (Price IDs)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_START_MONTHLY=price_1ABC123
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_START_YEARLY=price_1DEF456

# ❌ WRONG (Payment Link URLs - will now be converted)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_START_MONTHLY=https://buy.stripe.com/xxx
```

### Webhook Secret

Ensure your webhook secret is configured:

```bash
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### Success URL Configuration

The app automatically configures the success URL:

```typescript
success_url: `${NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}&plan=${planId}`
```

## Monitoring Webhook Processing

Check your server logs for these key messages:

1. **Webhook Received:**
   ```
   🔔 Webhook: checkout.session.completed received
   Session ID: cs_xxxxx
   ```

2. **Metadata Extracted:**
   ```
   ✅ Processing checkout for user: abc123 plan: smart yearly: false
   ```

3. **User Updated:**
   ```
   📝 Updating user document in Firestore...
   User ID: abc123
   Plan: smart
   Limits: { uploadsLimit: 50 }
   ```

4. **Success Confirmation:**
   ```
   ✅✅✅ USER PLAN UPDATED SUCCESSFULLY ✅✅✅
   User: abc123
   New plan: smart
   Upload limit: 50
   ```

---

## Troubleshooting

### If Plan Still Not Showing:

1. **Check Server Logs** for webhook messages
2. **Verify Firestore** - Check the user document manually:
   - Does `plan` field = the purchased plan?
   - Is `uploadsLimit` set correctly?
3. **Check Stripe Dashboard** - Verify webhook endpoint is active
4. **Test Webhook** - Use Stripe CLI to resend the webhook:
   ```bash
   stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
   ```

### Common Issues:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Missing userId in webhook" | Ensure checkout session includes `metadata.userId` |
| "Missing planId in webhook" | Ensure checkout session includes `metadata.planId` |
| Webhook not firing | Check Stripe Dashboard > Webhooks > Events |
| Plan updates but doesn't show | Increase polling duration or manually refresh |
