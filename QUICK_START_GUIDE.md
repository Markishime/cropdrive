## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: EUR prices not showing
**Solution:** Check console for errors. API might be rate-limited (1500 requests/month). The system will use fallback rate (0.20 EUR per MYR).

### Issue: Not redirecting after registration
**Solution:** Check browser console for errors. Make sure Firebase is properly configured in `.env` file.

### Issue: Dashboard doesn't show name
**Solution:** Make sure you filled in the "Name" field during registration. The name is stored in Firebase.

### Issue: Toast notifications not appearing
**Solution:** Make sure `<Toaster />` component is in `src/app/layout.tsx`. This was already added in previous fixes.
